# Epilepsy-Seizure-Detection-and-Epileptogenic-Zone-Localization-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
It is an ongoing research project aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of identifying epileptic seizures and pinpointing the specific brain regions responsible for them using Deep Learning Techniques.
The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust and automated system that can detect epileptic seizure activity within iEEG signals and accurately localize the epileptogenic zone, where the seizures originate on the BERNBarcelona dataset. LSTM, GRU, 1D CNN, and Transformers are being employed to train and test models for accurate seizure detection. To localize the brain regions responsible for seizures, an autoencoder, KNN, Adaptive Gradient Boosting, SVM, MLP, and a specialized 1D CNN are being used.
